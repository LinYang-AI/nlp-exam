# NLP FINAL SUBMISSION MARIIA, LIN, MARTIN

Hello we have run our entire notebook: 

"FINAL_NLP.ipynb" in Google Collab, and in total it takes about 20 minutes to train all the models. 

You also would need to manually upload all of the files on Google Collab when running it. 

However this won't be needed, because we have included all of our inputs. 

Thank you very much. 

Best Regards, 
Mariia, Lin, Martin
